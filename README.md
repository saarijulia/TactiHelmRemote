# TactiHelmRemote
An android application to act as a remote for the TactiHelm tactile cycling helmet prototype. 

On launching, the app attempts to establish a bluetooth connection to a HC-06 bluetooth module for arduino. 
When a button is pressed on the remote, a bluetooth signal is sent to the prototype to trigger a specific tactile cue.

Further development: consider integrating with cycling radar functionality.
